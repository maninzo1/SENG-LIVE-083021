### Phase 3

#### What are we learning?

- Ruby!

#### Phase Objectives:

- Understand the principles of Ruby as a language including principles of object oriented programming
- Understand the characteristics of a relational database
- Perform CRUD actions with a database using Active Record
- Design an API to handle CRUD actions
- Communicate with an API using different HTTP verbs
- Create and present a project with a React frontend and a database-backed API backend

# Ruby Fundamentals

### Lecture Deliverables

- Create a CLI(command line interface) that will:
  - Print a greeting and prompts user to enter name (puts vs print)
  - Capture and save users entry (gets, chomp, strip, variables)
  - Print a menu of options for user to select from:
    - User can create a new donation
    - See a list of organizations available for donations(iteration, arrays, hashes)
    - Exit program
  - Handle users selection and allow a user to continue using app, looping through the program until exit is selected. (conditionals, loops)

### Lecture Take aways

- Variables
- Methods
- Conditionals
- Arrays
- Hashes
- Loops
- Iteration
- puts
- binding.pry

### How to work on this project:

1. `cd` into the donations_tracker directory
2. run `./bin/run` to execute CLI.
3. If permission is denied when running the above command, you will need to provide executable permission. Run the following command: `chmod +x ./bin/run`
